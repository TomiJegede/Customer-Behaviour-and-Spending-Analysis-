# Customer Behavior and Spending Analysis for RetailCo

## Overview  
This project was part of a school assignment for my Masters program at **Northeastern University** and it focuses on analyzing customer behavior using R and statistical methods. The dataset created using ChatGPT, contains information on 6,000 RetailCo customers, including demographic data, spending scores, purchase frequency, and loyalty tier details (RetailCo is a fictional company).The goal of the analysis is to uncover insights that can improve customer engagement and inform strategic decision-making.
